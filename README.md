# Proyecto-PHP-eCommerce
This is a project of a PHP eCommerce using MVC. 
> I didn't expend time in the CSS code, I didn't care so much in how was looking. But I expend the time in the PHP code.

In the code you will find:
- User registration with your form
- htaccess paths
- Models and records
- User login
- Store categories
- Store products
- Section showing the products
- Shopping cart
- And store order
> I did not link the cart to any bank account or create payment processes.
